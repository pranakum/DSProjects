# Insofe Modules Test Projects:
PGP Program INSOFE
Cute2
•	To Predict the Rating of a Food Item based on the ingredients present in it. 
	StepAIC , VIF, and Regularization and used for feature selection.
	PCA is used for dimensionality reduction. 
	Performance Metric: Root mean square error (RMSE).

Cute3
•	To predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not and alarm in case of a fraudulent transaction.
	Class imbalance is handled using SMOTE.
	Models Built: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XgBoost and Stacking.
	Performance Metric: F1-score.

Mith (Mid-Term Hackathon)
•	To predict and classify the degree of damage in the state of the building using post-earthquake data.
	Merging data from different files and feature engineering is done.
	Models Built: Naïve Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Xgboost
	Performance Metric: Accuracy.

Cute04
•	Identify t-shirts by their graphic type.
	The model identifies the 'graphic type' of t-shirts with the t-shirt image as an input and the graphic type of the t-shirt as the output.
	Keras flow directory approach and Convolutional Neural Networks architectures are used for model building.

•	Predict the food rating based on Customer review.
	This problem aims at understanding the customer preferences based on the text reviews.
	CNN 1-D and LSTM architectures are used for model building.

Project Hackathon and Defense (PHD)
•	Predicting the potential fraudulent provider under healthcare claims.
	This problem aims to create a modeling framework to predict the potential fraud by provider for submission of fraudulent claims to the insurer for reimbursement of claim amounts.
	Models Built: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Xgboost
	Performance Metric: F1 score.
	Language: R
