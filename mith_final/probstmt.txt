INSOFE Mid Term Hackathon: 8th,9th Sept 2018
BACKGROUND & PROBLEM:
Earthquakes are one of the most unpredicted natural disasters affecting the Earth and its environment for billions of years since its inception. Adding to this, we as humans, are making it even worse by drilling for oil and natural resources around the world.

 

Buildings are worse hit during an earthquake due to the fact they are deeply rooted with their foundation in the earth. Immediately after the tremors, it is critical to determine the degree of damage to prioritize disaster response measures.  These damages may not be visible by visual inspection and earthquake usually covers a large amount of area. However, some post-earthquake data is still collected which is useful in predicting the state of the building.

 

Hence a machine learning model determining the degree of damage or classifying them in three different levels is desired and you are required to build that in this project.  Note that this data contains information from both before and after the earthquake. Hence the use of this model is not immediately after the earthquake but after collecting some data after the quake.
